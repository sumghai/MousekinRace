  <Mousekin_MuroidineAddiction.description>A chemical addiction to muroidine. Long-term presence of muroidine has caused neurological adaptations at the cellular level, so the brain can no longer function properly without the methylxanthine alkaloid.\n\nWithout regular consumption of muroidine-rich beverages like Chonko nut brew, withdrawal symptoms will begin. However, extended abstinence will force the brain to adapt back to its normal state, resolving the addiction.</Mousekin_MuroidineAddiction.description>
