	<!-- EN: description->In ages past, mice once squabbled over berries, nuts and fertile mouse maidens, their uncivilized ways blighting the land. Through the teachings of [deity0_name] and his thirteen disciples, we came to honor our forefathers for bestowing us the gift of life by keeping our flesh and spirits pure, and to venerate the meadows and forests that nourish us. For those that heed the wisdom of [deity0_name] are rewarded with everlasting life in The Great Garden, while the deviants and the wicked shall wander The Wasteland forevermore. -->
	<Mousekin_IdeoDesc_Kingdom.rules.rulesStrings.0>description->在過去，白鼠族們曾為漿果、堅果和可生育的白鼠女爭吵不休，它們不文明的行為毀壞了這片土地。經過[deity0_name]和他的十三個門徒的教導，我們開始保持我們肉體和精神的純潔，以感謝祖先賜予我們的生命，並崇敬滋養我們的草地和森林。那些聽從[deity0_name]智慧的白鼠族將在大花園中獲得永生，而離經叛道的惡鼠將永遠流浪荒原。</Mousekin_IdeoDesc_Kingdom.rules.rulesStrings.0>

	<!-- EN: description->For generations, our ancestors toiled in the fields and mines of the Kingdom, chafing under the heavy taxes levied by nobles. The mice of the woods, moved by our plight, shared a feast of vension poached from the King's own forests, while teaching us the ways of brotherhood and equality. Inspired by their generosity and wisdom, we turned our backs on those who would exploit us for their own gain, and built a society where every mouse could squeak their mind and enjoy the fair fruits of their own labors. -->
